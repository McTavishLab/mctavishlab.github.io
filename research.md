Members of the McTavish Lab focus on developing efficient methods that take advantage
of the novel information in large scale data sets, with an emphasis on reproducibility and open science.

## Current projects:



* ### Extensiphy: Placing taxa in a sequence alignment and phylogeny using Next Generation Sequencing reads

Testing the effects of choice of reference genome and SNP calling pipeline parameters on phylogenetic inference.

[Github repo](https://github.com/McTavishLab/extensiphy)


* ### TreeToReads: Simulating pipelines to generate Next Generation Sequencing reads from realistic phylogenies

[GitHub repo](https://github.com/snacktavish/TreeToReads)

* ### Physcraper: Automated phylogenetic updating
