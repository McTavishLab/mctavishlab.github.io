## Postdoctoral Researchers

* Luna L. Sánchez Reyes \\

    Luna started her second postdoc at UC Merced in August 2019. She did her PhD at UNAM with Susana Magallón, focusing on the understanding and testing of methods to estimate species diversification processes using a wide range of organisms as models of study. She is widely intertested in science communication and is an active participant of the open science movement. Her current work in projects such as `Datelife` and `The Open Tree of Life` focuses on making available scientific information on time of lineage divergence for easy reuse and reanalysis in Science and Education. She has been working on the Physcraper Python package software development, a
    tool that establishes interoperability framework for biological databases, to continually update and enrich existing expert phylogenetic data with public DNA sequence data from more taxa.

## Graduate Students
* Jasper Toscani Field \\

    Jasper is a second year graduate student in Quantitative and Systems Biology. He is interested in evolutionary dynamics of disease genomics and what we're actually doing with all the biological sequence data we generate. He currently works on a program that can rapidly update genome-scale phylogenies with new, related taxa. This method is being applied to gonorrhea data in collaboration with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Jasper previously worked on the phylogenomics of avian blood parasites at San Francisco State University.

* Lesly Lopez \\

    Lesly Lopez is a fourth year graduate student in Quantitative and Systems Biology. She is involved in the NRT Training Program in Intelligent Adaptive Systems at UC Merced. She is interested in the development and application of statistical methods to detect gene flow, specifically localized gene flow. She also studies assessing biases that could affect the performance of these methods.

## Undergraduate students

* Joseline Velasquez \\
<img src="/assets/Joseline.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 200px;"/><br>

    Joseline graduated from UC Merced in 2020 with Human Biology & Psychology degrees. She started in the Lab on the summer of 2019 to understand adpative introgression between African, Indicine, and Taurine cattle populations, to further understand the domestication process that gave rise to modern cattle. She will be starting graduate school Fall 2021 at Boston University.  

## Previous lab members:

### Postdoctoral Researcher

* [Martha Kandziora](https://blubbundbla.github.io/plantastic/)

    The key motivation for my research is to understand what drives speciation and how biodiversity is maintained, with a focus on the roles of spatial, historical and ecological processes. I use phylogentic methods to investigate how diversity is generated and maintained mostly focusing on flowering plants. Currently, in the McTavish Lab I program a tool to automatically update phylogenies.

### Rotation students
* Yumary Vasquez \\

     Yumary Vasquez is a first year graduate student in the Quantitative and Systems Biology program. She is broadly interested in computational biology and evolution. Her system of choice is insects because of the amazing evolutionary work that can be studied, but she personally hates bugs.


### Undergraduate Researchers

* Michael Decicco
* Ashley Marin
* Alejandra Morales
* Gurshaan Nagra
