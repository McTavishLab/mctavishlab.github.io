## Postdoctoral Researcher

* [Martha Kandziora](https://blubbundbla.github.io/plantastic/)
    
    The key motivation for my research is to understand what drives speciation and how biodiversity is maintained, with a focus on the roles of spatial, historical and ecological processes. I use phylogentic methods to investigate how diversity is generated and maintained mostly focussing on flowering plants. Currently, in the McTavish Lab I program a tool to automatically update phylogenies.

## Graduate Students

* Jasper Toscani Field \\

	Jasper is interested in evolutionary dynamics of disease genomics. He currently works on a program that can rapidly update genome-scale phylogenies with new, related taxa. This method is applicable at all scales of phylogenomic analyses but is specifically targeted to updating a large scale phylogeny with many (thousands) of new taxa. Jasper previously worked on the phylogenomics of avian blood parasites at San Francisco State University.
* Lesly Lopez
* Yumary Vasquez \\

Yumary Vasquez is a first year graduate student in the Quantitative and Systems Biology program. She is broadly interested in computational biology and evolution. Her system of choice is insects because of the amazing evolutionary work that can be studied, but she personally hates bugs.
