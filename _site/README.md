This is a starter kit for making an academic webpage using github
pages. It is based on my personal website, hosted at
[www.jabranham.com](www.jabranham.com). 

Feel free to fork this project in order to get your own site going (I
have a
[blog post](http://jabranham.com/blog/2016/01/making-academic-website.html)
that should help you get started), but please note the license
(below).

Here's a list of things you'll probably want to do right away:

* Change the personal information in the `_config.yml` file (name,
  email, description, etc)
* Update the `index.md` file to whatever you want. This is the
  "homepage" for your website.
* Create whatever subpages you want. I've included `teaching.md` as an
  example template. So that would be served at
  www.yousite.com/teaching. 
* Change the page links in `_includes/header.html` to go to the pages
  you just created in the above step. These will also be displayed
  along the top of your site.
  
That's probably enough to get started right away. Feel free to contact
me with any questions you have!
